# MASTER PROJECT HANDOFF
## Architectural Overview & Handoff Reference

### Program Overview
This document serves as the master project handoff reference for the Q-Saudi Work Follow reconstruction program. It synthesizes architectural decisions, core system models, data boundaries, and technical stack details to guide engineering execution across Phase 0 through Phase 18.

---

### System Architecture Summary
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18 SPA built with Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React icons, RTL Arabic alignment, PWA Service Worker.
- **Server Stack**: Node.js with Express server in `server.ts` / `server/app.ts`, running via `tsx` in development and bundled to `server-dist/server.cjs` via Esbuild for production (`"start": "node server.ts"`).
- **Persistence Stack**: Firebase Firestore (multi-tenant collections) & Firebase Authentication (via `firebase-admin` on server and `firebase/app` on client).
- **Project Setup Workflow**: Accepted 8-Layer Project Setup model (`src/services/projectSetupWorkflow.service.ts` & `src/components/wizard/ProjectSetupWizard.tsx`).
- **Domain Services**: Canonical drivers, carriers, materials, fleet rows, pricing rules, and trip dispatch repositories.

### Handoff Directives
1. **Repository Authority**: All reconstruction work operates under the rules defined in `docs/reconstruction/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md`.
2. **Phase Continuity**: Refer to `docs/reconstruction/02_PHASE_LEDGER.md` for current active phase and unit state.
3. **Quality Gates**: All code changes must pass through gates defined in `docs/reconstruction/04_VERIFICATION_AND_PUSH_GATE.md`.
