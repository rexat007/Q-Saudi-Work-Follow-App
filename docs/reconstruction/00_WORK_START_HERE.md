# Q-SAUDI WORK FOLLOW — RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
## WORK START HERE & OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

### Executive Summary
Welcome to the repository-governed reconstruction program for Q-Saudi Work Follow. This program manages the systematic engineering transition of the application from historical patch-based feature development to a hardened, server-authoritative, production-grade enterprise platform (Phase 0 through Phase 18).

This directory (`docs/reconstruction/`) contains repository-governed current contracts and clearly marked historical records. Governance changes through bounded, reviewed documentation units; it is not an immutable snapshot.

**Current state has one owner:** [02_PHASE_LEDGER.md](02_PHASE_LEDGER.md). Use it for the active phase/unit, next unit, closed units, open-debt routing and execution rules. Do not use Studio copies or historical release reports as competing ledgers.

The historical P0-U5 unit was documentation-only. Whole-App i18n and residual remediation are merged and accepted for this reconstruction stage; remaining mixed/bilingual labels are deferred non-blocking debt, not authorization to reopen localization.


### Current continuation — local Codex owner-review gate

- Verified merged main: `1f7f3344e65dfc9b6837b10cb5349827da1587eb` (P8-B2, PR #58).
- Current work is Phase 8 / P8-B3, locally implemented and awaiting owner review; exact state belongs only to [02_PHASE_LEDGER.md](02_PHASE_LEDGER.md).
- P8-B1 and P8-B2 are MERGED / SOURCE_VERIFIED / CLOSED; their merge evidence is in the ledger.
- Continue in the actual local Codex Git repository. Inspect branch, HEAD, tracked and untracked scope; preserve the existing worktree.
- Next action: owner review of the local P8-B3 implementation and documentation. Completion does not authorize commit, publication or another unit. Publication requires a later explicit owner instruction; owner merge remains manual.
- P8-B4 remains NOT_STARTED. Historical handoffs are evidence, not continuation instructions.

### Core Operational Principles
1. **GitHub Main Is Code Truth**: The remote `main` branch on GitHub is the sole source of code truth.
2. **Minimum Necessary Governance**: Use the streamlined method in [STREAMLINED_RECONSTRUCTION_EXECUTION_METHOD.md](STREAMLINED_RECONSTRUCTION_EXECUTION_METHOD.md). Combine or skip gates that add no material protection; preserve extra gates for high-risk work.
3. **Bounded Batches, Not Endless Micro-Units**: Prefer one coherent batch for related safe work with a shared purpose and regression surface. Split only when risk, ownership or verification requires it.
4. **No Greenfield Rewrites**: Existing application code is valuable asset material. Reconstruction hardens, converges, and stabilizes capabilities rather than discarding existing working features.
5. **Area-Wide Review Before Editing**: Review the full relevant family, then fix the coherent defect family rather than stopping at the first visible symptom.
6. **Server Authority**: The backend (Node/Express/Firebase Admin) is the sole authority for business logic, pricing computations, trip state transitions, and persistent data reconciliation.
7. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Every database query, outbox item, REST endpoint, and UI state context must be strictly isolated by `projectId`.
8. **Responsive / Cross-Device Invariant**: Field UI must function flawlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports with strict RTL Arabic layout discipline.
